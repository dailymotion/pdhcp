##Compilation & packaging

##Server usage

##Client usage

##Known bug & limitations

- PDHCP does not support DHCPv6 (not a fan of SLAAC, are you?).
- PDHCP only supports Ethernet MAC addresses (sorry FFDI and Infiniband friends, though it's just a matter of a few changes to support arbitrary MAC addresses).
- there are no known bug sofar (but PRs are more than welcome if you find some).
